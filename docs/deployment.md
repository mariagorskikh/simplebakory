# MCP Direct HTTP Implementation Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the direct HTTP implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that avoids EventSource/SSE compatibility issues with Node.js v23.

## Overview

The direct HTTP implementation uses:
- `direct-server.js`: A pure HTTP-based MCP server
- `direct-client.js`: A client implementation that communicates via HTTP only

This approach bypasses the SSE-related compatibility issues while maintaining all MCP functionality.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### Server Deployment

1. Create a Dockerfile for the server:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose the server port
EXPOSE 3002

# Start the server
CMD ["node", "server/direct-server.js"]
```

2. Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t mcp-direct-server .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3002:3002 mcp-direct-server
```

#### Client Deployment

The client can be deployed in a similar way:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Set environment variable for server URL (if deployed separately)
ENV SERVER_URL=http://server-hostname:3002

# Start the client
CMD ["node", "client/direct-client.js"]
```

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment

For production environments, Kubernetes provides scalability and management:

1. Create a Kubernetes deployment for the server:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mcp-direct-server
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mcp-direct-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mcp-direct-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mcp-direct-server
        image: mcp-direct-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3002
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "200m"
            memory: "256Mi"
```

2. Create a service to expose the server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mcp-direct-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: mcp-direct-server
  ports:
  - port: 3002
    targetPort: 3002
  type: ClusterIP
```

### 3. Standalone Server Deployment

For simpler deployments, you can run the server directly on a VM:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server with PM2 (for production):

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start the server with PM2
pm2 start server/direct-server.js --name "mcp-direct-server"

# Make PM2 start on boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The server and client support the following environment variables:

**Server:**
- `PORT`: Port number (default: 3002)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: CORS origin setting (default: '*')

**Client:**
- `SERVER_URL`: URL of the MCP server (default: 'http://localhost:3002')

## Monitoring

For production deployments, implement monitoring:

1. Health checks:
   - The server provides a `/health` endpoint for basic health checking
   - Use `/status` for more detailed status information

2. Logging:
   - Implement a logging solution (e.g., Winston + ELK stack)
   - Monitor server logs for errors and performance issues

3. Metrics:
   - Add Prometheus metrics for requests, response times, etc.
   - Create dashboards in Grafana for visualization

## Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication**:
   - For production, add authentication (API keys, JWT, etc.)
   - Update the server to validate authentication tokens

2. **HTTPS**:
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with SSL termination

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Consider adding request throttling for high-load scenarios

## Scaling Strategy

The direct HTTP implementation can be scaled horizontally:

1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Deploy multiple server instances
   - Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, Kubernetes ingress) to distribute traffic

2. **Database Integration** (for persistent sessions):
   - Modify the server to store sessions in Redis/MongoDB
   - This allows multiple server instances to share session data

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Verify all functionality works with the direct implementation
2. ✅ Test with expected load patterns
3. ✅ Implement security measures (HTTPS, authentication)
4. ✅ Configure proper logging and monitoring
5. ✅ Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
6. ✅ Document API endpoints and usage

## Maintenance Strategy

1. **Updates**:
   - Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
   - Test updates in a staging environment before production

2. **Backups**:
   - If using a database for sessions, implement regular backups
   - Document backup and restore procedures

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review logs and metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

## Client Integration

Clients can connect to the deployed server:

1. **Direct Integration**:
   - Use the `direct-client.js` as a reference implementation
   - Adapt to different programming languages as needed

2. **SDK Development**:
   - Consider developing a slim SDK for different languages
   - Document the API protocol for custom implementations
